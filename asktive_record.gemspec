  spec.description = "AsktiveRecord is a Ruby gem designed to bridge the gap between human language and database\
   queries. It lets you interact with your Rails database as if you were having a conversation with a knowledgeable \
   assistant. Instead of writing SQL or chaining ActiveRecord methods, you simply ask questions \
  in plain Englishâ€”like (or any language) 'Who are my newest users?' or 'What products sold the most last month?' \
  â€” and get clear, human-friendly answers. AsktiveRecord translates your questions into database queries using LLM \
  behind the scenes, so you can focus on what you want to know\, not how to write the query."
